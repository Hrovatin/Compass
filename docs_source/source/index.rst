Welcome to Compass's documentation!
===================================

Compass is an algorithm to characterize the metabolic state of cells based on single-cell RNA-Seq and flux balance analysis. 
Cellular metabolism, a key regulator of immune responses, is difficult
to study with current technologies in individual cells. We therefore
developed Compass, an in silico approach to infer metabolic status of
cells based on transcriptome data, which is readily available even in
single cell resolutions. For a detailed description of the algorithm, refer to the
`biorxiv
preprint <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.912717v2>`__.

These pages have guides on how to install and use Compass, including a walkthrough of an analysis to replicate figures from the preprint.
