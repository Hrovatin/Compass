### In-Silico Modeling of Metabolic Heterogeneity using Single-Cell Transcriptomes
Cellular metabolism, a key regulator of immune responses, is difficult to study with current technologies in individual cells. We therefore developed Compass, an in silico approach to infer metabolic status of cells based on transcriptome data, which is readily available even in single cell resolutions.

For instructions on how to install and use Compass, visit the [documentation](https://yoseflab.github.io/Compass/). For a detailed description of the algorithm, refer to the [biorxiv preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.912717v2).
