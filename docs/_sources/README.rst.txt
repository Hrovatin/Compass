In-Silico Modeling of Metabolic Heterogeneity using Single-Cell Transcriptomes
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cellular metabolism, a key regulator of immune responses, is difficult
to study with current technologies in individual cells. We therefore
developed Compass, an in silico approach to infer metabolic status of
cells based on transcriptome data, which is readily available even in
single cell resolutions.

This page provides an installation guide and a workthrough of a standard
analysis. For a detailed description of the algorithm, refer to the
`biorxiv
preprint <https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.912717v2>`__.

Install
-------

Installing CPLEX (required for Compass)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compass depends on IBM CPLEX to run optimization procedures. The full
edition is available for free for academic use.

See our instructions
`here <https://github.com/YosefLab/Compass/wiki/Installing-CPLEX-Tutorial>`__
for an in depth tutorial on installing CPLEX

\ *Note: Make sure to get the full edition (free for academic use) and
not the Community Edition*\ 

Installing Compass
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The best way is to install directly from this Github repository using
the following command:

.. code:: bash

   pip install git+https://github.com/yoseflab/Compass.git

Now to test if everything is installed, simply run:

.. code:: bash

   compass -h

You should see the help text print out if installation was succesful :)

Running Compass
---------------

Broadly speaking, Compass takes in a gene expression matrix scaled by
transcripts per million, and outputs a penalty reaction matrix, whereby
higher scores correspond to a reaction being **less** likely.

Running Compass (Simple)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Input file ``expression.txt`` should be a tab-delimited text file
containing gene expression estimates (TPM) with one row per gene, one
column per sample. Must contain both row and column labels,
corresponding to genes and sample IDs/names respectively.

.. code:: bash

   compass --data expression.txt --num-processes 10

Below is an example of the formatting for gene expression (We only show
a small portion of the matrix):

\ *Note: For every individual sample, Compass takes roughly 8 to 24
hours to calculate the reaction penalties (varying by machine). This can
be expedited by running more than one process at once. In addition,
Compass saves the results of all samples that it has already processed.
Therefore, Compass can also be stopped and restarted after it is done
processing a subset of samples.*\ 

Running Compass (Advanced settings)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Compass also allows users to customize a variaty of settings seen below:

.. code:: bash

   usage: compass [-h] --data FILE [--model MODEL] [--species SPECIES]
                  [--media MEDIA] [--output-dir DIR] [--temp-dir DIR]
                  [--torque-queue QUEUE] [--num-processes N] [--lambda F]
                  [--num-threads N] [--and-function FXN] [--num-neighbors N]
                  [--symmetric-kernel] [--input-weights FILE]
                  [--penalty-diffusion MODE] [--no-reactions] [--no-metabolites]

See our instructions
`here <https://github.com/YosefLab/Compass/wiki/Compass-Advanced-Usage-Tutorial>`__
for an in depth tutorial on using Compassâ€™s advanced settings

Postprocessing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once Compass has finished running, it is important to apply
postprocessing to the data in order to convert reaction penalties (where
high values correspond to low likelihood reactions) to reaction scores
(where high values correspond to likely reactions).

Our `compassR package <https://github.com/YosefLab/compassR>`__
appropriately postprocesses the data and provides an easy, expressive
framework for conducting subsequent analyses.

Outputs
~~~~~~~

When Compass has completed, the outputs for all samples are stored in a
tab delimited file ``reactions.tsv`` in the specified output directory
(``.`` directory when running Compass by default).

Below is an example of the output matrix:

\ *Note: While compass is running, it will store partial results for
each sample in the ``_tmp`` directory/*\
