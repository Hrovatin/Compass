Installing CPLEX
================

CPLEX is an optimization engine that COMPASS uses and it must be
installed from IBM. We note that it may be simpler to download the
installation files locally and SCP/File Transfer them over to the
corresponding server.

First navigate to the main page for CPLEX
`here <https://www.ibm.com/products/ilog-cplex-optimization-studio>`__

COMPASS requires the full edition of CPLEX. However, if you are an
Academic (Student or Faculty) you can get a copy for free.

Click the ‘Get student and faculty editions’ link:

Register an account or Log In to an existing account. Once logged in,
scroll down to the ‘Software’ section and to a download page for “ILOG
CPLEX Optimization Studio” v12.9.

Here there are a bunch of options. Find the one corresponding to your
operating system, for example “IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio 12.9
for Linux x86-64 Multilingual (CNZM2ML)” and check it. Then click
‘Download Now’ at the bottom of the page. Then you probably will need to
click the ‘install / re-install Download Director’ popup on the bottom
and follow the instructions there.

Finally, you will be able to download
``cplex_studio129.linux-x86-64.bin``.

Once the file has been transferred, on the Ubuntu instance, execute the
installer by running the following commands:

First install Java (required by CPLEX) if you haven’t already done so.

::

   sudo apt-get install default-jre

Then:

::

   cd ~
   chmod +x cplex_studio129.linux-x86-64.bin
   sudo ./cplex_studio129.linux-x86-64.bin

Follow the instructions in the installer, accepting the license
agreement and choosing to install to the default path
``/opt/ibm/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio129``.

Afterwards, if it has installed successfully, remove the installer file
with ``rm ~/cplex_studio129.linux-x86-64.bin``

Lastly, we need to install the Python module that comes with cplex. To
do this, run these commands:

::

   cd /opt/ibm/ILOG/CPLEX_Studio129/cplex/python/3.6/x86-64_linux
   sudo python3 setup.py install

If all is good, cplex will be installed! To test this simply open a
python instance and run the following command

::

   import cplex

If there are no errors, you’re good to go!
